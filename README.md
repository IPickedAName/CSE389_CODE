# CSE389_CODE <br/>
Code for the To-Do list website. <br/>
Group project consisting of Brian, Reyad, Dory, Juriasi. <br/>
Part of a CSE 389 course final project requiring a proposal website(flesh-out optional) of any application we wished to create. <br/>
If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Below are the to-do lists as of 11/26/2021. <br/>
I'm still figuring out git but I hope it's clear so far. <br/>
We need to look at the live chat code at w3 schools and adjust the format to match our vision. <br/>
The profiles are self-explanatory but you can ask me or Brian any questions. <br/>
Not 2 important but the toggle dark mode feature needs to be looked at regarding the text box adjusting its colors to the dark background. <br/>
**important** Fix input storage when refreshing the list, so the items are saved. <br/>
